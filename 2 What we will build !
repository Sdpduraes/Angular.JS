So, basically, we will build an App, a RealEstate app, where we can:

- sort things by lists, 
- work with forms, 
- create buttons that will show and hide details.

We will have  a repeater that lets us take a list of data and then provide a single template for it and just 
list out that data on the screen.

We will also learn about :

- pipes
- http implementations
- how to structure angular
- use components and services
- typescript
